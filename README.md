# mongoose-subresource-integrity

Ultralight, non-dependent and minimalist open-source package to recursively generate **sha-384 subresource integrity hashes** and store them into [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) schema with [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) to authenticate **.js** and **.css** files.

```js
const sri = require('mongoose-subresource-integrity');

sri.saveSubresourceIntegrityHash(
  "../../models/IntegritySchema",
  "./public/css"
);
```

Subresource Integrity or SRI is a [W3C recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/) to provide a method to protect website delivery from CDN-served malicious code.

To use SRI, a website author wishing to include a static resource can specify a cryptographic hash of the resource in addition to the location of the resource. Browsers fetching the resource can then compare the hash provided by the website author with the hash computed from the resource. If the hashes don't match, the resource is discarded.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/app.js"
        integrity="sha384-+/M6kredJcxdsqkczBUjMLvqyHb1K/JThDXWsBVxMEeZHEaMKEOEct339VItX1zB"
></script>
```

This package aims at automating the process of generating cryptographic hashes in order to facilitate their access through a call to the MongoDB database.

## Features

- Focus on high performance
- Low memory usage
- Executable for generating applications quickly
- High availability for synchronization with CDN systems
- Simple deployment with one-line integration

## Tech Stack

**Server:** Node, Express, Mongoose

## Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Node.js 0.10 or higher is required.

If this is a brand new project, make sure to create a `package.json` first with the [`npm init` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file) and install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads). Then:

```bash
  npm i mongoose-subresource-integrity 
```

## Importing

```js
// Using Node.js 'require()'
const sri = require('mongoose-subresource-integrity');

// Using ES6 imports
import saveSubresourceIntegrityHash from 'mongoose-subresource-integrity';
```

## Overview

### Connecting to MongoDB

First, we need to define a connection. If your app uses only one database, you should use `mongoose.connect` (`createConnection` take a `mongodb://` URI, or the parameters `host, database, port, options`).

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const url = "mongodb://localhost:27017/YOUR_DATABASE_NAME";

mongoose.connect(url,
  {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology:true
  }
);

const database = mongoose.connection;

database.on("error", console.error.bind(console, "connection error:"));

module.exports = database;
```

**Note:** _If the local connection fails then try using 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost. Sometimes issues may arise when the local hostname has been changed._

**Important!** Mongoose buffers all the commands until it's connected to the database. This means that you don't have to wait until it connects to MongoDB in order to define models, run queries, etc.

### Defining a Model for hashes storing

Models are defined through the `Schema` interface. We need a pairing system between the path and the hash of each file, defined as follows within the schema :

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const { Schema } = mongoose;

const IntegritySchema = new Schema({
    filepath: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
    hash: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true,
    }
});

IntegritySchema.set('toJSON', {
    transform: (document, returnedObject) => {
        returnedObject.id = returnedObject._id.toString()
    }
});

const Integrity =  mongoose.model("integrity", IntegritySchema);

module.exports = Integrity;
```

Once we define a model through `mongoose.model('integrity', IntegritySchema)`, we can use it through the following function :
```js
sri.saveSubresourceIntegrityHash(
  "../../models/IntegritySchema",
  "./public/css"
);
````

Where the first argument is the path to the file describing the Mongoose schema, and the second is the one containing the set of subfolders and statics files to which we want to collect the hash for the Subresource Integrity checkin.
## Usage/Examples

```javascript
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "6308ca92d8424fda52e63eae"
  },
  "filepath": "public/css/index.css",
  "__v": 0,
  "hash": "sha384-ql4jKwyXlyERdFY59Fq4T+ILy2bHHIusVmm1UBuSl+ddrgTfN/kAlG7lbY2oo645"
}

```
